        That's almost all there is to it. Of course, you might add a file you don't want, so you can git rm the file. That removes the fileâ€”from both the index and the work-tree. Note that this does not touch any commits! It literally can't: a commit is permanent and unchanging. Once made, no commit can ever change. (The only thing you can do is throw it away entirely, making a new and improved one instead.)
